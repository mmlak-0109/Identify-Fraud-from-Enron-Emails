## Welcome to my "Identify Fraud from Enron Emails" Project Page!

I completed this project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree "Intro to Machine Learning" course.

In this course, I learned how to do the following things:

- Deal with an imperfect, real-world dataset
- Validate a machine learning result using test data
- Evaluate a machine learning result using quantitative metrics
- Create, select and transform features
- Compare the performance of machine learning algorithms
- Tune machine learning algorithms for maximum performance
- Communicate my machine learning algorithm results clearly

For this project, I built an algorithm that is a "person of interest (POI) classifier".  It's purpose is to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

The relevant files file for this project can be found by clicking the "View project on GitHub" link above.  The `.ipynb` file called "P5_Final_Project_Notebook" is where I documented my work.

Enjoy!
